Tests

Basic idea:  
  - launch client(s) and server that each take their standard inputs from 
    invocations of testreceiver
  - enter input into running client(s) and server by using testsend
    to send that input to the corresponding testreceiver
  - capture diffs with expected output from each client/server to determine 
    whether anything changed
This strategy requires a two-step shutdown strategy:  
 1. shutting down a client or server; then 
 2. shutting down that component's testreceiver (TESTRECEIVER_END)

First, enter test machines info in testsend.config
  - first column is a name for each machine
  - second and third columns are hostname and port number for testsend program
These values should be consistent with values at top of test scripts dotest and 
dotest2.  Also, make sure you have passwordless ssh access to each test machine

Testing scripts:
  - dotest -- test a single client and server
    expected output files: client.out1 and server.out1
    sample runs (after configuration above):
	./dotest
	more *1.diff       # these files will be empty if test succeeds
	
  - dotest2 -- test two clients and one server
    expected output files: client1.out2, client2.out2, server.out2
    sample runs (after configuration above):
	./dotest2
	more *2.diff       # these files will be empty if test succeeds

Original description of tests


single client
 1. start server on rns202-21
    rns202-21%  server 2747 | diff - test.server.out

 2. start client on cs21346.cs
    cs21346%    cat test.client.in - | client rns202-21.cs.stolaf.edu 2747 | 
                diff - test.client.out1

 3. commands/messages:
     a. enter DUMP command on server
     b. enter DONE command (plus following extra newline) on client
     c. enter DUMP command on server
     d. enter EXIT command on server

dual client
 1. start server on rns202-21
    rns202-21% server 2747 | diff - test.server.out2
 2. start client on cs21346.cs
    cs21346%   cat test.client.in - | client rns202-21.cs.stolaf.edu 2747
 3. enter DUMP command on server
 4. start client on rns202-2
    rns202-2%  cat test.client.in - | client rns202-21.cs.stolaf.edu 2747
 5. enter DUMP command on server
 6. enter DONE command and newline on cs21346 client
 7. enter DUMP command on server
 8. enter DONE command and newline on rns202-2 client
 9. enter DUMP command on server
10. enter EXIT command on server
